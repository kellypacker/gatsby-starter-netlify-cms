  Only a small part of the town survived, with about 110 structures still
  standing, including one of many once operational gold mills.

  The park is northeast of Yosemite, 13 miles east of Highway 395 on Bodie Road,
  seven miles south of Bridgeport. From U.S. 395 seven miles south of
  Bridgeport, take State Route 270. Go east 10 miles to the end of the pavement
  and continue 3 miles on an unsurfaced road to Bodie. The last 3 miles can at
  times be rough. Reduced speeds are necessary. Call the park if there are any
  questions about road conditions.
history: >-
  "Bodie began as a mining camp of little note following the discovery of gold
  in 1859. By 1879, Bodie had a population of approximately 5,000â€“7,000 people
  and about 2,000 buildings. The first signs of decline appeared in 1880 when
  other boom towns lured residents away. The newspaper ceased publication in
  1912 and the railway was abandoned in 1918. The last mine closed in 1942 as
  dynamite and other resources were redirected towards the war effort. The town
  was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961.
